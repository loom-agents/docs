title: Runner
description: Orchestrates agent execution and manages multi-turn interactions
---

The `Runner` class orchestrates the execution of [Agents](/docs/reference/agent), handling multi-turn interactions and providing execution context.

## Creating a Runner

```typescript
import { Agent, Runner } from "loom-agents";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Assistant",
  purpose: "Help with general tasks",
  // ... other config
});

const runner = new Runner(agent, {
  name: "MainRunner",
  max_depth: 5,
  context: {
    user_id: "user-123",
    session_start: Date.now(),
  },
});
```

## Runner Configuration

The `RunnerConfig` interface defines available configuration options:

```typescript
interface RunnerConfig {
  max_depth?: number; // Optional: Maximum number of turns (default: 10)
  name?: string; // Optional: Runner name (default: "Runner")
  id?: string; // Optional: Unique ID (default: auto-generated UUID)
  context?: Record<string, any>; // Optional: Additional context data
}
```

## Running an Agent

The `run` method executes the agent and manages the interaction flow:

```typescript
// Simple string input
const result = await runner.run("Help me write a resume");

// Rich context input
const result = await runner.run({
  context: [
    { role: "user", content: "I need help with my resume" },
    { role: "assistant", content: "I can help! What industry are you in?" },
    { role: "user", content: "Software engineering" },
  ],
});
```

## Managing Execution Flow

The Runner handles:

1. Executing the agent with the provided input
2. Processing agent responses and tool calls
3. Managing multi-turn conversations up to `max_depth`
4. Tracing execution with the integrated [Tracer](/docs/reference/trace)

## Handling Results

The `run` method returns a `RunnerResponse` which is a souped-up [AgentResponse](/docs/reference/agent)

```typescript
interface RunnerResponse<T> extends AgentResponse<T> {
  trace: Trace; // The execution trace
}
```

## Accessing Execution Data

The Runner provides methods to access execution details:

```typescript
// Get the most recent trace
const lastTrace = runner.getLastTrace();

// Get all traces from this runner
const traces = runner.getTraces();

// Render the last trace for debugging
console.log(lastTrace.render());
```

## Execution Depth and Handling

The Runner prevents infinite loops by enforcing a maximum execution depth:

```typescript
const runner = new Runner(agent, {
  max_depth: 5, // Agent will stop after 5 interaction turns
});
```

If the maximum depth is reached before the agent completes its task, the runner will return the current state with the status from the agent's last response.
